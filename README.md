DESCRIPTION OF TASK:
         This code builds a professional-looking interactive quiz web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It presents a series of multiple-choice questions, allowing users to select answers and receive instant feedback. The app highlights correct and incorrect responses, tracks the user's score, and displays the final result at the end. Styling includes a modern gradient background, clean card layout, and responsive design elements. The application is self-contained in a single file and can be run directly in any browser.
